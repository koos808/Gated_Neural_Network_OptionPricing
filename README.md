# Gated Neural Network(GNN) Option pricing

* Gated Neural Network for Option Pricing implementation version Keras
* I referenced the code on this site.(`https://github.com/sapphire21/NN-Option-Pricing`)
* Since the referenced code is the keras **1.xx** version, I converted it to a code that works with the **2.xx** version.
* I confirmed that it runs normally from start to finish.
* Verified with S&P 500, hangseng, eurostoxx50 call option data.
